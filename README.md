# Audio-Visualizer
Audio Reactive Scatterplot Galaxy
3D scatterplot visualization of audio files (.wav only).

Creates a 3D plot widget of a dynamic scatter plot.


This is a hobby project I created to:

-visualize music I've created

-familiarize myself with PyQt Graph and OpenGL

-explore matplotlib colormaps


Visualizer options:

audio_filename: filepath of .wav file to play (and plot)

cmap: matplotlib colormap to use for plotting

camera distance, azimuth, elevation

number of stars

number of stars in galaxy

strength of audio influence

line length of simulated lightning

refresh_ms: time between each plot refresh, in milliseconds
